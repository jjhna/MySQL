Lesson 16: Adding Node JS to application

To start the process of node first: use the command mysql-ctl cli to start the command line for mysql
This will start the initalization of the database
For example if you want to access and edit the database named "books" or "join_us" then you must enter that info into the connections: host, user and database (especially the database).
You should be abble to get the host and user from the credentials when accessing the mysql-ctl cli command line

Then make sure that the database you want to use exist, if not then create it by using the create table command
When you're all done with that exit the cli and go back to the original terminal

Afterwards enter into the node module folder list: cd node_modules

Then start the application, such as: node app.js
